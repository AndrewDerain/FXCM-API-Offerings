#About the API Offerings

FXCM currently offers 3 trading APIs for free:  Java API, FIX API and ForexConnect with each of them connecting directly to FXCM’s trading server.
 
In order to register for our FIX API there is minimum account size requirement of USD $25K per account while the other 2 APIs don’t require a minimum account size. It is also very important to note that historical prices are available only via ForexConnect and Java API
